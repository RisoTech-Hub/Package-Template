## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to do all the work.

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django
